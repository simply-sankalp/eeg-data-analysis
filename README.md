# EEG Data Analysis Project

This project aims to provide a comprehensive Python-based solution for analyzing EEG (Electroencephalogram) data. The process involves calculating Power Spectral Density (PSD) values, segmenting the signal into different frequency bands such as delta, theta, alpha, and beta brainwaves, and correlating PSD values to specific brain activities.

## Features

- **PSD Calculation**: Utilize Python libraries such as NumPy and SciPy to compute the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of EEG signals.
  
- **Frequency Band Segmentation**: Implement algorithms to split EEG signals into distinct frequency bands including delta (0.5 - 4 Hz), theta (4 - 8 Hz), alpha (8 - 13 Hz), and beta (13 - 30 Hz) brainwaves.

- **Correlation Analysis**: Employ statistical techniques to correlate PSD values with different brain activities or cognitive states.

- **Data Visualization**: Utilize matplotlib or other visualization libraries to create plots and graphs for easy interpretation of results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/simply-sankalp/eeg-data-analysis.git
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Ensure that your EEG data is properly preprocessed and formatted. This may include removing artifacts, filtering, and resampling if necessary.

2. **PSD Calculation**: Use the provided functions to calculate the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of your EEG signals.

3. **Frequency Band Segmentation**: Apply algorithms to segment the PSD values into different frequency bands such as delta, theta, alpha, and beta brainwaves.

4. **Correlation Analysis**: Conduct correlation analysis between PSD values and specific brain activities or cognitive states. This may involve statistical techniques such as Pearson correlation coefficient or cross-correlation.

5. **Data Visualization**: Visualize the results using matplotlib or other visualization libraries. Generate plots and graphs to illustrate the relationship between PSD values and brain activity.
